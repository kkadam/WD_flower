setup_frac.F90, read in etot from continuation file                                     **

scfin_frac.F90, initialized etot initial data and kappas                                **

state.F90, compute pressure from p = (gamma-1) (E_tot - E_kin)                          **
           E_tot = 1/2 rho v**2 + rho eps

delta.F90, no changes - should be fine if the pressure is current as c_sound            **
           calculated as gamma p / rho

ritecont_frac.F90, ritecont_frac_new.F90, dump out etot in continuation file            **
            also added temps to data written out

advect_bc.F90, floor etot and have etot follow the same boundary conditions as rho

advect_frac.F90, etot treated like rho

vel.F90, should redefine the kinetic energy part of etot when the velocity is 
         limited but not doing that on the first pass

vel_bc.F90, no change because etot not changed in vel

visc.F90, no change
